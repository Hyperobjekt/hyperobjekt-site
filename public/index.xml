      <description>Can a school district overcome the effects that poverty has on its students? To answer that question, we need to rethink how we measure a school district’s quality.
Despite popular belief, average test scores are a bad indicator for measuring how much education students receive in a district. Average test scores by grade tell us more about the socioeconomic conditions of the students in a district than the district’s impact on student learning.</description>

      <description>This figure shows the average performance of black and white students in each US school district in math and English language arts in grade 3. Each circle is a school district (one of ~2400 district in which there are enough white and black students to reliably estimate both white and black achievement in grade 3).
The size of the bubble is proportionate to the number of black children enrolled in the school district.</description>
