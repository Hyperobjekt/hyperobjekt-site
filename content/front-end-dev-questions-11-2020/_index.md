    Your client needs a Mapbox map of the contiguous US that displays census data for multiple census years. You will need to generate a series of Mapbox tilesets for use by the map application. Explain how you will go about writing a set of automated tasks to generate the tilesets. What technologies, libraries, and services will you use? 
q2: >
    You are tasked with building a React application that can be published as an NPM module and loaded into a Gatsby site. This React application will be an interactive map that loads several sets of polygon and point features. It will be loaded as a component into a Gatsby site for its ultimate production presentation. Map features will be provided by the client as geojson files. 


    1. List some of your favorite libraries and frameworks for building componentized React apps. Explain how they might or might not be helpful for this project.
 
    2. What steps would you take to ensure maintainability and minimize technical debt?

    3. What strategies would you employ to ensure that the mapâ€™s contents are accessible to users with phone- and tablet-sized devices?
q3: >-
    You are tasked with building a Gatsby site that will serve as the introductory platform or shell for an interactive Mapbox map. The site must conform to the following specifications:



    1. All language strings should be editable via a static site CMS (like Netlify CMS) and eventually the site may be available in multiple languages.

    2. All images must be optimized and offered as a src set.

    3. A designer will create custom icons, and these will be used repeatedly throughout the Gatsby site as SVG vector images.

    4. The site scoping document dictates 5 separate breakpoints, and all site pages must be responsive and all contents accessible at all breakpoints.

    5. The site must meet WCAG AA testing standards.

    6. The site must have no keyboard traps.

    7. The site must score a minimum Lighthouse score of 90 for Mobile devices.


    List some of your favorite libraries and frameworks for building static sites. Explain how they might or might not be helpful for this project. What steps would you take to ensure that the specifications listed above are met?
